<h2>Programming Languages</h2>
...The human being works to understand the computer through commands and special languages called programming languages, which are a package of commands that are entered into the computer, and the process of encrypting and analyzing them in several stages so that the computer can absorb them Thus, it is customary for computers to accommodate and implement programming languages divided into two, high-level languages that are also easy for humans to understand, and low-level languages,It is also called machine language, which is difficult for a person to understand and understand, and the commands and instructions that man writes through editing or writing programs come to the computer as the latter follows the programming process using rules specific to the language used to write, encrypt and implement commands, and each programming language is characterized by With a set of characteristics that distinguish them from other languages and make them suitable, of course there are characteristics common to some programming languages, and programming languages are developed based on computer development (Hardware).
